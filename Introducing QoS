IP was designed to provide best-effort service for delivery of data packets and to run across virtually any network transmission media and system platform.
Network traffic from business-critical and delay-sensitive applications must be serviced with priority and protected from other types of traffic.
This is the job of QoS.
Better performance from the network is achieved by managing bandwidth provisioning, delay, jitter (delay variation), and packet loss with QoS mechanisms.
Many QoS building blocks or features operate at different parts of a network to create an end-to-end QoS system.
Examples:
 - traffic is classified and assigned a priority when forwarded by access switches
 - different congestion management mechanisms for different types of traffic are used at the core


Converged Networks
------------------
Converged networks carry multiple types of traffic, such as voice, video, and data, which were traditionally transported on separate and dedicated networks.
Converged networks must balance the requirements for each different traffic types, which can compete for available resources.
Voice and some video traffic are not tolerant of delay, jitter, or packet loss, and excessive amounts of any of these will result in a poor experience for the end users. 
Data flows are typically more tolerant of delay, jitter, and packet loss but are very bursty in nature and will typically use as much bandwidth as possible.
The different traffic flows on a converged network will be in competition for network resources.
The critical, time-sensitive flows must be given priority in order to preserve the quality of this traffic.

Four major problems affect quality on converged networks:
- Bandwidth capacity:  Multiple traffic flows compete for a limited amount of bandwidth and may require more bandwidth than is available.
- Delay: Delay is the time that it takes for a packet to reach the receiving endpoint after being transmitted by the sender.
  There are variable delay components (processing and queueing delay) and fixed delay components (serialization and propagation delay).
- Jitter: Jitter is the variation in latency or end-to-end delay that is experienced between when a signal is sent and when it is received.
- Packet loss: Loss of packets is usually caused by congestion, faulty connectivity, or faulty network equipment.

Different techniques are employed to manage quality issues:
- increase the link capacity to accommodate the bandwidth requirements
- use a queuing technique to prioritize critical traffic or enabling a compression technique to reduce the number of bits that are transmitted for packets on the link
- a dejitter buffer can buffer packets and then play them out in a steady stream
  This process adds to the total delay of the packet that is being delivered as an audio or video stream but allows for a smooth delivery of the real-time traffic.
  If the amount of jitter that is experienced by the packet exceeds the dejitter buffer limits, the packet is dropped and the quality of the media stream is affected.
 

QoS Defined
-----------
The ability of the network to predictably provide business applications with the service required for those applications to be successfully used on the network.
QoS provides tools for managing network congestion, shaping network traffic, using links more efficiently, and setting traffic policies across the network.
QoS gives priority to some sessions over other sessions.
When queue buffers overflow, packets are dropped dterministically with minimal business impact.
QoS policies selectively delay or drop packets when contention arises.
QoS is not a substitute for bandwidth. 
If the network is congested, packets will be dropped. 
QoS allows the administrators control on how, when, and what traffic is dropped during congestion.

NOTE: Quality of Experience (QoE) measures end-user perception of the network performance. 
      QoE is not a technical metric; it is a subjective metric describing the end-user experience. 
      You deploy QoS features to maximize QoE for the end user.
