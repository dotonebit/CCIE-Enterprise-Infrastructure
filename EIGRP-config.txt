Basic EIGRP Configuration
-------------------------

! Create an EIGRP routing process and enable EIGRP on specified interfaces.

router eigrp 12
 network 192.168.255.0
 
! The valid range for the autonomous system number is 1 to 65,535.
! The 'network' command matches one or more local interfaces.
! The 'network' command matches addresses that are within the defined subnet.
! Wildcard masks can be used to target a specific host/IP address, entire network, subnet, or even a range of IP addresses.
! If no wildcard mask is used, a classful mask is assumed.


EIGRP Static Neighbor
---------------------

! Define an EIGRP static neighbor.

router eigrp 12
 network 192.168.255.0 
 neighbor 192.168.255.3 GigabitEthernet0/0

! The interface through which the neighbor is present and EIGRP exchanges routing updates must be specified in the 'neighbor' statement.
! NOTE: The 'network' command is still required to enable EIGRP on the interface.
! CAUTION: Configuring static neighbors effectively disables multicast on the interface. EIGRP will no longer process multicast packets on the interface.\


EIGRP Passive Interface
-----------------------

! Passive interfaces will suppress EIGRP packets and not form EIGRP neighbor adjacencies.
! The interface network will still be included in the EIGRP topology database and advertised to EIGRP neighbors.
! There are two ways to enable passive interface: default and per interface.
! The 'default' keyword sets all interfaces to passive.
! Individual interfaces can be specified to override the default passive interface state by using the 'no passive-interface' command.

(DEFAULT)

(PER INTERFACE)

Basic EIGRP Configuration
-------------------------

! Create an EIGRP routing process and enable EIGRP on specified interfaces.

router eigrp NEON
 address-family ipv4 unicast autonomous-system 12
  network 192.168.255.0
  
! The 'router eigrp' command creates an EIGRP configuration, it does not create an EIGRP routing instance by itself.
! An EIGRP named configuration is a base configuration that is required to define address-family configurations under it that are used for routing.
! NOTE: In named configuration, the EIGRP autonomous system number must be defined separately.


EIGRP Static Neighbor
---------------------

! Define an EIGRP static neighbor.

router eigrp NEON
 address-family ipv4 unicast autonomous-system 12
  neighbor 192.168.255.1 GigabitEthernet0/0
  network 192.168.255.0

! The interface through which the neighbor is present and EIGRP exchanges routing updates must be specified in the 'neighbor' statement.
! NOTE: The 'network' command is still required to enable EIGRP on the interface.
! CAUTION: Configuring static neighbors effectively disables multicast on the interface. EIGRP will no longer process multicast packets on the interface.


EIGRP Passive Interface
-----------------------

! Passive interfaces will suppress EIGRP packets and not form EIGRP neighbor adjacencies.
! The interface network will still be included in the EIGRP topology database and advertised to EIGRP neighbors.
! There are two ways to enable passive interface: default and per interface.
! The 'default' keyword sets all interfaces to passive.
! Individual interfaces can be specified to override the default passive interface state by using the 'no passive-interface' command.
