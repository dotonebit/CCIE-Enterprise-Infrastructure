! This file contains EIGRP configuration examples.

********************
*** CLASSIC MODE ***
********************

! Create an EIGRP routing process and enable EIGRP on specified interfaces.

router eigrp 12
 network 192.168.255.0
 
! The valid range for the autonomous system number is 1 to 65,535.
! The 'network' command matches one or more local interfaces.
! The 'network' command matches addresses that are within the defined subnet.
! Wildcard masks can be used to target a specific host/IP address, entire network, subnet, or even a range of IP addresses.
! If no wildcard mask is used, a classful mask is assumed.



******************
*** NAMED MODE ***
******************

! Create an EIGRP routing process and enable EIGRP on specified interfaces.

router eigrp NEON
 address-family ipv4 unicast autonomous-system 12
  network 192.168.255.0
  
! The 'router eigrp' command creates an EIGRP configuration, it does not create an EIGRP routing instance by itself.
! An EIGRP named configuration is a base configuration that is required to define address-family configurations under it that are used for routing.
! NOTE: In named configuration, the EIGRP autonomous system number must be defined separately.
