! This file contains EIGRP configuration examples.

********************
*** CLASSIC MODE ***
********************

Basic EIGRP Configuration
-------------------------

! Create an EIGRP routing process and enable EIGRP on specified interfaces.

router eigrp 12
 network 192.168.255.0
 
! The valid range for the autonomous system number is 1 to 65,535.
! The 'network' command matches one or more local interfaces.
! The 'network' command matches addresses that are within the defined subnet.
! Wildcard masks can be used to target a specific host/IP address, entire network, subnet, or even a range of IP addresses.
! If no wildcard mask is used, a classful mask is assumed.


EIGRP Static Neighbor
---------------------

! Define an EIGRP static neighbor.

router eigrp 12
 network 192.168.255.0 
 neighbor 192.168.255.3 GigabitEthernet0/0

! The interface through which the neighbor is present and EIGRP exchanges routing updates must be specified in the 'neighbor' statement.
! NOTE: The 'network' command is still required to enable EIGRP on the interface.
! CAUTION: Configuring static neighbors effectively disables multicast on the interface. EIGRP will no longer process multicast packets on the interface.\


EIGRP Passive Interface
-----------------------

! Passive interfaces will suppress EIGRP packets and not form EIGRP neighbor adjacencies.
! The interface network will still be included in the EIGRP topology database and advertised to EIGRP neighbors.
! There are two ways to enable passive interface: default and per interface.
! The 'default' keyword sets all interfaces to passive.
! Individual interfaces can be specified to override the default passive interface state by using the 'no passive-interface' command.

(DEFAULT)

router eigrp 12
 network 192.168.255.0 
 passive-interface default
 no passive-interface GigabitEthernet0/0


(PER INTERFACE)

router eigrp 12
 network 192.168.255.0 
 passive-interface GigabitEthernet0/0
 
 
EIGRP Metric Weights
--------------------

! Tune the EIGRP metric calculation by adjusting the metric weights or K-values.

 router eigrp 12
  metric weights 0 5 4 3 2 1
 
! Command syntax: metric weights tos k1 k2 k3 k4 k5
! K-values are constants that convert an EIGRP metric vector into a scalar quantity. Valid values are 0 to 255.
! tos is for Type of Service. This value must always be zero.


EIGRP Timers
------------

(HELLO)

interface GigabitEthernet0/0
 ip hello-interval eigrp 12 30

! Command syntax: ip hello-interval eigrp as-number seconds
! The Hello interval is expressed in seconds. The range is from 1 to 65,535.


(HOLD)

interface GigabitEthernet0/0
 ip hold-time eigrp 12 50

! Command syntax: ip hold-time eigrp as-number seconds
! The Hold time is expressed in seconds. The range is from 1 to 65,535.


EIGRP Upgrade CLI
-----------------

! To convert classic mode configurations to named mode.

router eigrp 12
 eigrp upgrade-cli NEON

! The command must specify an instance name for the new named mode configuration.
! This is a one-time, one-way command.
! After conversion, the running configuration on the device will show only named mode configurations.
! The command must be run for every classic mode configuration (per AS).



******************
*** NAMED MODE ***
******************

Basic EIGRP Configuration
-------------------------

! Create an EIGRP routing process and enable EIGRP on specified interfaces.

router eigrp NEON
 address-family ipv4 unicast autonomous-system 12
  network 192.168.255.0
  
! The 'router eigrp' command creates an EIGRP configuration, it does not create an EIGRP routing instance by itself.
! An EIGRP named configuration is a base configuration that is required to define address-family configurations under it that are used for routing.
! NOTE: In named configuration, the EIGRP autonomous system number must be defined separately.


EIGRP Static Neighbor
---------------------

! Define an EIGRP static neighbor.

router eigrp NEON
 address-family ipv4 unicast autonomous-system 12
  neighbor 192.168.255.1 GigabitEthernet0/0
  network 192.168.255.0

! The interface through which the neighbor is present and EIGRP exchanges routing updates must be specified in the 'neighbor' statement.
! NOTE: The 'network' command is still required to enable EIGRP on the interface.
! CAUTION: Configuring static neighbors effectively disables multicast on the interface. EIGRP will no longer process multicast packets on the interface.


EIGRP Passive Interface
-----------------------

! Passive interfaces will suppress EIGRP packets and not form EIGRP neighbor adjacencies.
! The interface network will still be included in the EIGRP topology database and advertised to EIGRP neighbors.
! There are two ways to enable passive interface: default and per interface.
! The 'default' keyword sets all interfaces to passive.
! Individual interfaces can be specified to override the default passive interface state by using the 'no passive-interface' command.

EIGRP Metric Weights
--------------------

! Tune the EIGRP metric calculation by adjusting the metric weights or K-values.

router eigrp NEON
 address-family ipv4 autonomous-system 12
  metric weights 0 5 4 3 2 1 0

! Command syntax: 'metric weights tos k1 k2 k3 k4 k5 k6'
! K-values are constants that convert an EIGRP metric vector into a scalar quantity. Valid values are 0 to 255.
! tos is for Type of Service. This value must always be zero.
! The k6 argument is supported only in address-family configuration mode.


EIGRP Timers
------------

(HELLO)

router eigrp NEON
 address-family ipv4 unicast autonomous-system 12
  af-interface GigabitEthernet0/0
   hello-interval 20
   
! Command syntax: ip hello-interval eigrp as-number seconds
! The Hello interval is expressed in seconds. The range is from 1 to 65,535.


(HOLD)

router eigrp NEON
 address-family ipv4 unicast autonomous-system 12
  af-interface GigabitEthernet0/0
   hold-time 40
   
! Command syntax: ip hold-time eigrp as-number seconds
! The Hold time is expressed in seconds. The range is from 1 to 65,535.
